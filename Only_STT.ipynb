       "' Hello everybody and welcome to Program Expert. In this video I\\'ll be covering modules and packages. Now modules and packages are things in Python that we use to better organize our code. So put simply a Python module, simply a Python file, so anything that ends in .py, and a Python package is simply a directory containing Python modules. So this allows us to better separate  We\\'re going to create our code and organize it into different files and different directories so that we can find code easier, debug things easier, just have a more organized codebase. Now up until this point in time, we\\'ve only been working on one individual Python file. The reason for this is our programs are very small and we don\\'t need to separate things up. However, once you start getting into larger programs, things that have tens of thousands of lines of code, you\\'re going to  You don\\'t have multiple Python files and likely multiple Python packages to really organize everything and separate individual components of your application. This is good practice, and in a large codebase you\\'ll see that there\\'s tons and tons of files, and most of these files don\\'t have a ton of code inside of them. They have maybe a few hundred lines of code, maybe a few thousand lines of code, but you don\\'t have a huge mass of files.  because it makes it very very difficult to actually go debug and find the code that you\\'re looking for. So let\\'s start talking about modules and packages. The first thing we do is we can create different modules and import them so we use them from a main module. So the first thing actually to look at here is that there is something known as a main module in Python. The main module is the module that is Ren. So we can actually check what...  the name of our module is or if the module is our main module or not is we can print out the special variable in Python and then add its name. So, underscore, underscore, name, underscore, underscore. Hopefully at this point in time you\\'ve started to understand that the double underscores mean something special, something unique in Python. So in this case if you go to any Python file and you print out the name and you run it, you\\'re going to see that you get main. This pretty much means you run it.  Run this Python file. The reason this is important is because you can import Python files, import Python modules from a module like this, and those modules will not be named main. Okay? Seems a little weird, but for now just understand whatever Python module you run is the main module. So what I\\'m going to do here is create another Python module. It\\'s going to be in the same directory that I\\'m in right now. I\\'m going to call this, let\\'s go with, ff.  Functions Now, this is going to contain a bunch of functions. So first of all, I should mention that when you\\'re naming your Python modules, you don\\'t want to use the same conventions as you would use when naming variables. So typically you\\'re going to have snake case. So you can see modules and packages in a snake case. You\\'re going to use lowercase as if possible, and while that\\'s pretty much all you have to know for naming the modules. Now you can have numbers in your modules.  But you should not have any special characters, you should not have any spaces, yes you actually can put a space in your module name, but if you do that it\\'s not going to allow you to import it from another file. So just make sure whenever you\\'re creating these modules that you do know where such and such has no spaces, no named characters, and you can actually import it which you\\'ll see how to do right now. So inside this function, the PyME module, what I\\'m going to do is put two func-  So I want to use from inside this file. So I want to separate my code out and put some logic in here and some in here and from here I want to use the logic inside of here. So I\\'m going to say defineFoo, just make a dummy function here and just print Foo like that. Let\\'s go defineBar and let\\'s print Bar like that. Guys, we have two functions inside Function.  How are we going to use these functions? Well, if we go inside modules and packages, the first thing I can do is just print run, okay? And then the fourth is I\\'m actually going to import the functions module. So, where do I use codes in a different Python file? First of all, right now, it should be in the same directory as the module that you\\'re accessing it from. So, in this case, I\\'ll access functions.py and the module.  I\\'ll be able to do that because they\\'re in the same directory as this file. They\\'re beside each other, you can see they\\'re in the same directory. So, how do I access it? Well, I\\'m going to say import functions like this. And this will actually import all the code from inside of this functions module. Okay, that\\'s great, but how do I use the code? Well, the way I use the code is I say functions dot and then name the function that I\\'ll...  So if I do function.foo, you\\'re going to see that foo prints out. And if I do function.bar, you\\'re going to see that bar prints out to the screen. There you go, that\\'s really the basics of importing modules. When you\\'re in the same directory as the module you want to import, you can simply import it by writing its name. Now one thing to keep in mind is that there is built-in modules as well. There\\'s modules like map.  And when you import these, these are special modules built into Python, and so you don\\'t need to be in the same directory as where they exist. They actually are on your computer somewhere, but Python knows where to look for them when you import them. So you should avoid naming your modules things that are built in module names. Sometimes you\\'ll do this accidentally and it\\'s fine, but typically you don\\'t want to name your modules something like math, right? Because if you do that, now you\\'re going to have a name confi-  with the built-in module named math. And I just wanted to mention that there is built-in modules as well, and they work a little bit different, like random math, so those modules we imported before clearly didn\\'t need to be in the same directory as them. In this case, we\\'re importing our own custom modules that we have created. Great, so that\\'s how you can actually run code from the modules. You use the name of the module as the prefix, and access it.  any of the code. Now just like writing functions, we can import classes as well. So let\\'s say class test like this. And instead of here, we can put anything, I\\'ll just put pass. So I can import or use this class. So maybe I\\'ll say t is equal to functions dot test like that. And I can print out t. And you\\'ll see that this works. We can instance of this test object. So you can import variables, you can import  functions you can import pretty much anything that you want. Great. Now that we have that, let me show you a few other ways that we can import this code. Because it\\'s not usually the best for us to have to use this prefix functions to access all this stuff from the functions module. Sometimes I just want to use bar, or I just want to use test, right? So I\\'m going to make it so I can do that. Well first of all, let me show you how we can rename this module.  module to be something different. So sometimes we still want a prefix when we\\'re using different components from this module, but we don\\'t want it to be the same as what the module name is. Maybe the module name is really long, maybe the module name conflicts with the variable function we have defined in our program, whatever the reason may be, sometimes we want to rename the module when we\\'re using it in here. So in this case I can say asf, but what this does is rename the module.  Welcome to the video for the first time in a while.  So, before we continue, I will just mention that all of your import statements should go at the top of your program. This is considered best prog-  This is not mandatory, they will still work if you put them in other places in the program. But, where you want to access needs to be below where you define the imports. So for example, if I do something like this, we would get a crash, and the reason we get a crash or an error here is because F is not defined yet. We haven\\'t imported yet, so we\\'re trying to access this function before we import. So that\\'s one of the reasons you put your imports at the top of the program.  It\\'s also just convention, makes it very easy to see what you\\'re importing, what you\\'re using, and to fix that if you need to. Great. So now we know how to import the module itself, and how to rename it, I want to show you how we can import specific things from the module, so we can avoid having to use this prefix. The way we do that is this. We say from, functions, imports, and whatever we want to use.  Hello, and welcome to the Food Bar and Test class.  So, now we\\'ve seen how to import things directly. I want to mention how we can import everything from a module. So,  Sometimes if you have a module that you\\'ve written yourself, you want to import everything from it. Okay? The way you do that is you use this asterisk. So rather than writing every single function in class name or very little whatever you want to access, you just use the asterisk and it gives you access to everything without the prefix. So if I do both or full, this works, it imports everything. Now this is a little bit dangerous to you.  and that you should only use if you\\'re actually going to be accessing everything from this module. The reason why this is considered bad practice is because oftentimes you\\'ll import or you\\'ll use this when importing from a large module and you\\'ll get a ton of stuff within your program. And it\\'s not that you actually want to use, it can just cause some problems. For example, if you import a function from this module that\\'s defined inside of your program,  Now you have a name conflection where the program has to pick which one it\\'s going to use and so I can be a little bit confusing. You just want to be careful when you\\'re importing stuff from a module and using the asterisks. I personally would stay away from using it unless you have a very good reason to do so. Alright, so now that we\\'ve done that, I just want to show you how from this module we can import stuff from this module. So let\\'s say here we want to do bar and foo.  We want to run a function. Let\\'s call this func, and just print out func. Now let\\'s say we want this to become our main module. We want to run this code first, so it\\'s going to import functions, right? So from functions import start. Then inside of here, I want to import func. So what I do is I say, alright, for run, modules, and  I get this import func like that. So I import statement up here. Alright, so I\\'ll start by showing you that if I remove this, I get rid of the import, I get rid of that code there. I go here, I run this, everything works fine. I get a crash right here. And that\\'s because all we do is import func. We don\\'t print anything, we just import this function. However, if I go back here and I change this...  So it looks like this. I go here and I run this func. Watch what happens. We get this issue. And it says, can import named func from partially initialized modules and packages? Most likely due to a circular import. So we talked about circular imports. A circular import pretty much means that from this module right here, you are trying to import this module, and this module is trying to import the module it just  So, if we look here, what actually is happening is from Modules and Packages we import Funk. Now, whenever you import a module, it actually runs all of the code inside of the module one time. So, let\\'s look at examples. If I go here and print Run, you\\'re going to see that now, when I run this, Run is actually printing out. And so, this can\\'t import name Funk. Ah, oh, it\\'s because I removed Funk, but you can-  Run is printing out when we import this module. So it actually runs all the code inside the imported module one time. So let\\'s go back to this example. So in one line now, if we go here and we import this module, what happens is all this code runs. So now, after we do this, it runs this line. We say from functions import star. So now we go back to functions, and the first line comes up here.  because we have to run this one time, it is from modules and packages import fox, now we go back here, and we run this line, and then we run this line, and we kind of just go infinitely between the two packages or between the two modules, sorry, because we have a circular import. So what a circular import is, right from here, we\\'re importing this, and from this, we\\'re importing this, so two things are importing each other, you get this kind of infinite loop where you go back and forth.  Because whenever you import a module, it runs all the code inside that module one time. So, you have to avoid certain imports. You can\\'t really do something like this. Instead, what you do is put any of the code that you want to separate out to different modules and have one main module that imports everything. Okay? So there is times in which modules can use code from each other, but a lot of times you have all your-  code separate, you have one main module and that main module is going to import stuff from all of the other modules rather than having this module import stuff from here and this module import stuff from here, it just gets confusing when you run into the circular import issue. Hopefully that makes sense, but I just want to show you that error because it\\'s pretty common and something that a lot of people run into and don\\'t understand why. Okay, so now I want to show you this one thing.  known as the name=\"main\". As we showed previously, when you print out the name of the module, it tells you if it\\'s the main module or otherwise what its name is. So in fact, let\\'s actually look at an example here. Let\\'s see what happens when I go here, and I import this module and I print name. So, you see that the name is functioned.  So the name of this module is functions, it is not main. So I go here, and I try to run a script. Run a script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script, script  Well, maybe I should very well, but the idea is that I want to use this as a module, so its code can be shared between this file, but also sometimes when I run this code, and when I run this code, I want this stuff to happen, but when I import it, maybe I don\\'t want this stuff to happen. So, only when I want some stuff to happen, when I run a module directly, not if I import the module, is actually very common you want this thing.  So how can we make it so this code is going to run if I actually run this module correctly, not if I import this module? Well the way we do this is the following. We put an if statement, we say if run square root of square root of m equals square root of square root of m. So this is the point of the name. What\\'s happening is we say, okay, if the name of the module is main, that means we ran the module. So we go ahead and...  to this, but if we import the module, its name is not made. Its name is what the name of the module is, and so we won\\'t end up running this. Hopefully this kind of makes sense, but notice if I run this we get a whole world. But if I go here and import the module, nothing happens. Well, the name prints out that\\'s from inside of here, but this code doesn\\'t run because its name is not made. So keep that in mind, but what if I-  So you\\'re writing multiple modules, you\\'re going to run all of these modules independently, but also use them as modules so that we can import code from them and use the code and share the code that\\'s inside them, and so you do something like this. Now let\\'s go here and do the exact same thing. So right here if name equals name, we will print, let\\'s just do modules and packages here. So in the same way,  Now, when I run this we get modules and packages. Perfect, that\\'s what I need to show you related to this. Sweet. So now we\\'ve pretty much exhausted everything we need to related to modules, now I\\'m going to talk to you about packages. As I said previously, a package is really a special directory, so a folder, that has a special file inside it and contains a bunch of Python modules. So let\\'s create a package.  Hey, guys.  What this file does is kind of initialize this package. And so now that we have this net.py file inside of here, it makes this folder, this directory, a package. And since it\\'s a package, this means I can import the package and use it like a Python package. But if I don\\'t have net.py, it\\'s not a package, it\\'s just a directory. So the net.py separates whether or not this is a package. Okay, hopefully...  Hi, I\\'m Mike Sands, and I\\'m going to do some stuff in a top-out that I\\'ll show you in a minute. The point is that now that we have this, we can actually import this code package. So what I\\'m going to do is go, let\\'s actually remove the functions here, and remove them from modules and packages, and let\\'s import the code package. So what I can do is import code. Now the reason I can do this is because it\\'s in the same directory as my main Python file.  But as you see that happens, we don\\'t get any errors, so I imported the package successfully. Now as I was saying, a package usually contains a bunch of Python modules, so we can\\'t organize and separate our code. So what I\\'ll do is create a few modules inside of here. Inside A.py, and let\\'s go here, and say B.py. Now inside of A.py, I\\'m going to print A.  I\\'m going to print B. So now, if I import code, but I import code.a instead, what will actually happen is I will import the A module from the code package. So this is how you can access things within the package. You put the package name, dot, and the module you want to access. So I\\'m going to be importing this A module from the code package.  So let\\'s do this and notice we get A. Notice we get A is because whenever you import a file the first time it\\'s going to run all the code inside of that file. So let\\'s do this now with B. Notice B print out. Great, that is perfect. Now what I\\'ll do is talk to you a little bit about this init.py file. Now this init.py file...  So, if I go here and just import the code package, you\\'re going to see that it runs right  it out because the net.py file is going to run as soon as you import the package. However, let\\'s see what happens if I import code.a. When I import code.a, notice that it still runs, and now a runs. Okay? So I\\'m just trying to show you that the net.py runs whenever you import the package. The reason why this is important and nice is because what I can do inside of here is actually import the modules directly into the package.  This seems kind of weird, I\\'m sure it\\'s a bit confusing, but I can do something like import A and import B. Actually, I need to do import dot A and dot B. I\\'ll talk about why we need to do that in one second. But now if I go and I import code, you\\'ll see that dot in that syntax. Okay, sorry guys, let me have a look at this for one second. I believe I need to do code dot A.  and code dot B actually so let\\'s save that and let\\'s run this and now notice A printout and B printout so let me just take a step back here and explain all those errors that just occurred because I want to do that pretty quickly previously I tried to do this I tried to do import dot A and import dot B now this is what\\'s known as a relative import but unfortunately I didn\\'t do it correctly and so we got an error so what I need to do is actually save the package  name, .a, and package name .b because both of these files, a and b, belong to the code package. And so if I want to import them, I import them with code .a and code .b. But notice what happens here is when I import the code package, the .py file runs, and it imports code .a and code .b, if print a and print b. So let\\'s run this one more time, and see.  A and B print. If I go to an app I know, and I run this, notice we get an error. This is kinda weird. It says no module named code. That code is not a package. Wait, why is this happening? I\\'m inside an app I know, and I run it. Why does this not work? But when I run from here, it does work. Well, the reason for this is that this is my main module. So when this is my main module...  I search for packages starting from this module. I search for code starting from this module. So, I don\\'t sound like Nick.py. I\\'m not actually using this code package because I\\'m in sound like Nick.py. It doesn\\'t know that it\\'s a part of this code package because the code package hasn\\'t been imported. Hopefully that\\'s kind of making sense. The point is that if I want to import A and B from here,  And I run this file, I have to do it just like I would normally do. I have to import A and import B. Now this works fine, but as soon as I add the code prefix, it doesn\\'t know what code is because code hasn\\'t been imported. But when I go here and I import code, now this package can exist in my Python execution environment. And then it runs and since code exists...  I can now access A, and I can access B. I know this has been confusing, so it\\'s required a little bit of practice to get used to, but the point is that where you start matters. So since I\\'m starting here on modules and packages, the way I\\'m going to import stuff inside of this package is different than if I were to run code directly inside of this package. Hopefully it\\'s kind of coming full circle here, but that is the point. So now if I go here and run this, of course-  this still works. Alright, so now that we\\'ve looked at that, let\\'s look at some other ways that we can import things from our package. So notice here that we imported code.a and code.b. Now inside of a and b we\\'re only printing things right now, so let\\'s actually make a function. Let\\'s say define capital A, and let\\'s just print out A, and let\\'s go in B, and you can guess what we\\'re going to do. We\\'re going to do A, capital B.  and print out v. Okay, so now inside here we have two functions. So let\\'s say from modules and packages I want to access those two functions. How would I do that? Well, there\\'s a few ways I can do this. The first way I can do this is I can say import code dot a like that, and then what I can do is say okay, dot print, so I can print code dot a dot a like that.  that if I run this, it prints out A. So that\\'s one way that I could do this. Another way that I could do this is I could say from code.a import A. And now I can use A directly like that without any issue. Another way that I could do this is I could say import code. And another way I could do this is code.a.  dot A, and in the same way, this works. So hopefully at this point you\\'re getting that there\\'s multiple ways that we can do this, that we can import these functions, but I want to show you another way. The other way we can do this is we can actually import what we want from inside of the init.py file, and then access it directly from this module. It\\'s going to seem a bit strange, but let me change these lines here and say  From code dot A, import A, and from code dot B, import B. So now I\\'m directly importing the A function and the B function from a knit dot py. So a knit dot py now has access to A and to B. Okay? So what I\\'m going to do now is I\\'m going to change this and I\\'m just going to say import code. And I\\'m going to show you the way to import code.  What I can do now is actually say code.a. So let me run this and notice that this works fine. Now this is really weird. Why am I able to do this all of a sudden? The reason I can do this is because what\\'s happening is when I import code, I\\'m running net.py. And since net.py imports a and imports b, I can directly use a and directly use b from code. Because now...  So I use the code, my code is what acts directly to A and B because the net.py file imported. Hopefully that makes sense, but that is what\\'s happening here. We\\'re getting access to A directly from the package because the net.py imports it. However, if I do this, and I run this, now no one works, right? Because we\\'re importing A or B from a net.py. So I use the code.  Now of course that also means that from code import a, b, and now I can just directly use a and directly use b. So let\\'s do it and notice it works. There we go, there\\'s a few different ways that we can import things from packages. So at this point in time we\\'ve actually been looking at something that\\'s known as absolute imports. Now absolute imports are where we actually specify directly the path that we want to import.  import things from. However, we also use something known as relative imports. Now relative imports, print says hey, based on the location I\\'m currently at, import this or import that. Seems a bit weird, but let me show you how it works. So for now we actually, now let\\'s change the specific import code. Let\\'s go and set A and B, and let\\'s remove our print stands here.  So, we can go ahead and leave the A and B functions so that this is imprinted out and put in our output when we\\'re doing stuff. Okay. So, what I want to show you now is actually let\\'s remove this as well. Is that we can from say the B file import the A module without getting a circuit input. Or the other way around, from A we can import B. So, how do I go about importing the B module from A? Well...  Here\\'s how we can do this. I\\'m going to type import code.a or import code.bs in this case. Now this works fine, and we\\'re using this as an absolute import. I\\'m specifying the package name, and I\\'m specifying the module that I want to import. But another way I can do this is using a relative import. Now a relative import is where I actually use the location of this file as kind of the base of where I import something.  So what I can actually do here is say, from.importNMB. Now what this is saying is, from the current package, or from the current directory, import DB file. That\\'s what I\\'m saying, B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B  I  And now what file were we in? We were in A. I can say actually let\\'s import code.a. And you should see that now this is going to work. So I\\'ll explain this again in a second. Let\\'s just run this and notice this works. So from here I\\'m importing code.a. So I\\'m importing this package in the A file. So I import the A file. Let\\'s go run this code. So now this will import works. And the reason it works is because we now know what pa-  We\\'re inside of the code package and so I say from dot I say okay from the current package that I\\'m in import the B file and I\\'m using the B file to access the B function so this is a relative import so I\\'m writing down to code dot B right I just do this from dot import B okay relative import that\\'s what it is alright so now that we\\'ve briefly  I want to show you a more advanced example here with a ton of packages and modules and show you how we can import things from those packages and modules. So what I\\'m actually going to do is delete everything that I have here. So I\\'m going to delete everything that we\\'ve made so far. So let\\'s move that out. Let\\'s close all those editors. Let\\'s start making some packages. So I\\'m going to say this is my main package.  Inside of here we\\'re going to make two other packages. We\\'re going to make the A package, and we\\'re going to make the B package. Now the B package should go in there, so let\\'s move that. So now we have A and B. However, these other packages are not packages because they don\\'t have the init.py file. So what I\\'m going to do is set up a square to square init, and then set up here the same thing. init.py ends.  Let\\'s go inside of A and B. So inside of A, I\\'ll make a new folder and let\\'s call this P1, so like package 1. And let\\'s make this package init underscore dot pi. And let\\'s go inside of B and let\\'s make  And let\\'s make this a package. Great, so I made 10 files, 10 packages, now we need some modules. So we have our main package right here. I\\'m going to make my first module outside of the main package. I\\'m going to call this main as well. I\\'m going to say main.py. Great, now let\\'s call it something else. Let\\'s call it main module.py. Okay, so we have main module.py. Now what I want to do is...  is I want to make a module inside of P1 and call this runCode.py and here we\\'ll just print runCode like that then inside of P2 we\\'ll make a module as well and we\\'ll just call this print something.py and this will print you guessed it, something  Now that we have all these modules and packages, let\\'s go to our main module and let\\'s see how we would actually import. Let\\'s go with run code or print something. How do we import those? So let\\'s start with run code. This is actually something you can follow along with if you want. Try to import run code. How would you do that? We first have to look...  at the main package which is main. The first thing we\\'re going to do is we\\'re going to import main. Now that we\\'re importing main we have to say, okay, well where is run code? Well run code is inside the A package. So now we need to import A. Okay, and now for me to import P1 and then import run code. So this way we can access the run code file. So let\\'s run this and see if it works. And notice that run code prints out all A.  is good. What about print something? What\\'s it do? Print something that\\'s going to change us to be P2 and then print something like that. That\\'s right. And notice everything works. There you go. That\\'s it for accessing this. Alright, so I\\'ve just cleared the screen in the last example that we had and now I\\'m going to get into a more advanced example that uses relative imports. That is worth noting.  that relative imports are really complicated, and it\\'s actually against best practices to use relative imports. I\\'m showing them to you because sometimes you will want or need to use them, and so it\\'s a good skill and knowledge to have. Anyways, most of the time it\\'s better to just use an absolute import because it\\'s a lot less ambiguous, but I will show you an advanced example here with relative imports. So the example I want is from running this main module, I want in-  import run code and from run code I\\'m going to import print something. So run code will be executed from the main module so import it. So we\\'re going to say import main.a.p1.run.score code. Okay so this is the code we\\'re going to run and then from here I\\'m going to import print something. Notice where print something is. It\\'s not in the same package. It\\'s not in the same apple package. It\\'s not even in two apple packages.  It\\'s pretty fun. We have to go to the main package and then to B and then to B2 and then access it. So how can we do this? Well first I\\'ll show you the absolute import. The absolute import is pretty easy. We just import main.b.p2.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p.p  Something like this. From . . . B. Sorry, . . . B actually. . . . P2 import print underscore something. Believe this is gonna work? Let\\'s test it out. And see. I noticed that this works. So let\\'s take a step back and explain what I just did here. So, what I\\'m saying is, okay, I\\'m gonna go up three levels. Or, sorry.  So I go to the current package, then I go to the parent package, then to the parent, then back to parent. And so what happens is since I\\'m inside of P1, I\\'m saying, okay, stay in P1, that\\'s what first dot says, then go to A. Okay, so now I\\'m going to A, so I\\'m going one directory level, and then from A I\\'m saying, okay, go to A. So now at this point I\\'m in A. So now I\\'m going to input the B package, okay, so now I\\'m going to input B.  then import p2, and then import print something. That\\'s how you do this with the relative import. Now, I get it like this, but we also could do it like this. import dot dot dot, and then like that. Now, if I do this, actually let\\'s check and see if this is going to work. Okay, so we actually end up getting an invalid syntax. So, this is why we can\\'t do the relative import in this fashion. Maybe a good example to actually show you here.  you actually have to use the front to be able to do this. Okay? So hopefully that makes sense, that you do this using the relative import. Now hopefully this gives you an idea of why you maybe don\\'t want to use the relative import because this is pretty complex, there\\'s a lot of things that can go wrong with using this, or at least is very ambiguous when you\\'re reading the code related to the relative imports, and so oftentimes you want to instead use the absolute import. Alright?  Alright, so now that we\\'ve looked at all of that, that\\'s pretty much all I need to cover related to packages and modules. Now, the routes and ports are pretty complicated, so don\\'t worry about them too much. Really, the main takeaways from this video is what the main module is. The main module is the module that you run. What a package is? A package is a directory that has a knit.py file inside it, and usually contains a collection of other Python modules.  The module is simply a .py file. Okay, so I need to hide this module. Run code this module. .py module, right? Main module, this module. Whereas the packages would be B, P2, P1, A, main, okay? Those are packages because I need .py in the side of them. Now all you need to know is how to import modules from packages, right? Now you don\\'t need to know how to do this using the relative import su- '"
